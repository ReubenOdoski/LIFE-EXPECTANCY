# LIFE-EXPECTANCY
**Life Expectancy Dashboard Report (2000-2015)**

**Prepared by: Reuben Chukwuma Odo**

**Overview**

This dashboard presents a comprehensive analysis of global life expectancy between 2000 and 2015, exploring demographic, economic, and health-related predictors including GDP, mortality, disease burden, immunization coverage, and healthcare expenditure. The insights help compare countries, identify improvement patterns, and evaluate factors influencing long-term human health outcomes.

**Objective**

The goal is to understand key life expectancy trends, identify improvement patterns, analyse critical influencing variables, and compare developed vs developing nations.

**Key Metrics**

\- Average Life Expectancy

\- Adult Mortality Rate

\- Infant & Under-5 Mortality

\- GDP per Capita

\- Health Expenditure (% GDP)

\- Immunization Rates

\- HIV/AIDS & Measles Prevalence

\- Improvement Score (2000-2015)

**Insights**

• Developed countries maintain higher life expectancy, while developing nations show strong upward trends.

• HIV/AIDS prevalence, infant deaths, and adult mortality significantly reduce life expectancy.

• Higher immunization and health expenditure correlate with higher life expectancy.

• Education shows strong influence on long-term health outcomes.

• Several developing countries show remarkable 15-year improvements.

**Recommendations**

• Strengthen immunization and childhood survival programs.

• Increase healthcare spending and access.

• Expand HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment.

• Invest in education as a long-term health driver.

• Support countries with stagnating or declining life expectancy.

**Conclusion**

Life expectancy improved globally from 2000-2015 with significant progress among developing nations.

Sustainable improvement requires continued investment in public health, education, and disease control.
